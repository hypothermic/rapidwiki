      Our Vision
======================

The main goals for this project are to build a robust wiki software
without any JavaScript, cookies or other client-side data processing.
This allows an enjoyable visit for everybody - even those concerned
about privacy who are using NoScript and JavaScript-blocking browsers.

      Quick setup
======================

1. Edit `wiki.xml` to your needs (the baseUrl and title must be set)
2. Run `jobs/sh/update_*.sh` to update the system

       Roadmap
======================

- Re-do this readme file
- Make the jobs
- Register/Login system
- Page creation system
  - Automatic changes to sitemap and navigate.php

     Contributing
======================

If you have features you would like to add to RapidWiki or complete
one of the tasks on the roadmap, please do contribute via GitHub.
You can do this by forking the project and pushing your changes to
the fork. Then, send a Pull Request (PR) to hypothermic/rapidwiki.

Pull Requests should always explain changes in the description,
as I don't have much time and it takes a while to read the code.

   Coding standards
----------------------
1. No trailing whitespaces anywhere
2. Use tabs (4) instead of spaces (except for this readme file.)
